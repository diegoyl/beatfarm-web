Beatfarm was originally created as a Kivy+Python app. To create this web-accessible version, the [Shiny Drum Machine](http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/shiny-drum-machine.html) step-sequencer library was used, which provides similar functionalities to those that were created for the original app.
